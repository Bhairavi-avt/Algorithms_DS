## 🎭 [Tiny-Troupe](./Tiny-Troupe)

An AI-driven simulation of multi-agent personas using TinyPerson. You can create your own personas, place them in an environment, and simulate role-based conversations.

🗣️ Includes multiple simulations such as:
- Lisa Carter (Data Scientist)
- Bhairavi (Grad Student)
- Mike (Professor)

## 🕵️‍♂️ [Final_Project – NYC Crime Analysis](./Final_Project)

Using NYPD Arrest Data, this project:
- Uses **supervised ML** to predict **crime severity**
- Uses **unsupervised clustering** to find **crime hotspots**
- Combines spatial and demographic analysis

Notebook: `Algo_for_DS_Final_Projectipynb.ipynb`
